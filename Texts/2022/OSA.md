## Inner Source and Closed Source

### Inner Source

* Inner Source is an adaptation of open source
* The code remains proprietary and can be seen only within a single organization or a small set of collaborating organizations

### Closed Source

* Closed Source has restrictions on usage, modification and distribution
* Protects intellectual property

## Open Source Review

* __Incorporation__: a developer may copy portions of an open source component into its own project
* __Linking__: a developer may link to an open source component
* __Modification__: a developer may make changes to an open source component
* __Translation__: a developer may transform the code by translating it from one language to another or from one programming language to another

### Legal Aspects

## Data Analysis

Data analysis focuses on the process of examining past data through business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling and evaluation, and deployment and it is a subset of data analytics.

## Workflow

1. Data ingestion
2. Data cleaning and transformation
3. Dimensionality reduction
4. Data analysis
5. Visualization

## Data Analytic Techniques

* Descriptive (what happened?)
* Diagnostic (why did it happen?)
* Predictive (what will happen?)
* Prescriptive (how can we make it happen?)
* Cognitive (what if this happens?)

## Descriptive

> What happened?

* Specialized metrics like [KPIs](kips.md) and Return on Investment (ROI)
* Generating sales and financial reports
* Accurate, comprehensive, live-data and effective visualizations

## Diagnostic

> Why did it happen?

* Supplemental to descriptive analytics
* Drill down, investigate descriptive metrics to determine root causes
* Find and isolate anomalies
* Apply statistical techniques

## Predictive

> What will happen?

* Use historical data to predict trends and reoccurrence
* Statistical and Machine Learning techniques

## Prescriptive

> How can we make it happen?

* Ingests hybrid data to predict future scenarios that are exploitable

## Cognitive

> What if this happens?

* Draw patterns to create what-if scenarios
* Determine what actions can be taken

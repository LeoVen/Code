# Serverless

* Cloud providers allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers
* Removes the concert about capacity planning, configuration, management, maintenance, fault tolerance or scaling of containers, VMs or servers
* Computing is done in short bursts where the results are persisted in storage

## Scalability vs. Elasticity

* **Scalability** is the ability of a system to add, remove, or reconfigure the hardware, software, and other resources to handle an increase or decrease in usage
* **Elasticity** refers to a systemâ€™s ability to automatically scale up or down resources to meet user demands

## Advantages

* More cost-effective
* Scales with demand automatically
* Eliminates server maintenance
* Better productivity

## Disadvantages

* Cold starts impact performance
* Not suited for HPC
* Monitoring and debugging is harder
* Security, due to a larger attack surface
* Vendor lock-in

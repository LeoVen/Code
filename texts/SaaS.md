# Software as a Service

## SaaS (Software as a Service)

SaaS is a cloud computing service that mainly focuses on cloud-based software and has a major part in the Cloud market share. The provider will install software on the server and provide access to the users that have subscribed to that software. The users do not need to install the application on their machines. But they can get access and navigate the software either using a web browser or an API.

Since the software is installed or stored in the server, you only have to store and analyze your data. There is no need to download the software, install it, manage it or update the software on your machine. Everything is managed and handled by the provider only.

SaaS is subdivided in three categories:

* Private Cloud
* Public Cloud
* Hybrid Cloud

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

IaaS from the name itself suggests this Cloud service is mainly focused on infrastructure. The provider will provide you with all the resources such as servers, storage capacity, and networking on demand. And as a user, you have to build your platform and run the application on it. This cloud service gives users the flexibility to choose resources of their own and can also upgrade as per their needs in the future.

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)

PaaS is the third and last sub-category of SaaS which offers cloud computing, where the provider allows you to use their cloud services such as managing, developing, and testing applications. Along with it, they provide you with all sorts of tools through the platform to run tests and development.

However, the providerâ€™s main role is to ensure, security, maintenance, and backups of the infrastructure.

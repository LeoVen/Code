* More fine tune control over the transformation of the data into useful data structures

## Data Warehouses

* Generally perform aggregations, hence column oriented
* Return queries very fast despite the large amount of data
* Infrequently accessed
* Generally reads from a Database and is read-only

## Data Mart

>A subset of a Data Warehouse

* Usually under 100 GB
* Allows different teams control over their own datasets
* Read-only
* Increases the frequency at which data can be accessed due to smaller datasets

## Data Lakes

*Azure Data Lake*

>A centralized storage repository that holds vast amounts of data in semi-structured or unstructured format

* Hoarding for data scientists
* Real-time analytics
* Machine Learning
* On-premise data

## Data Lakehouse

  * Azure Blob Storage
  * Azure Files
  * Azure Data Lake
* Semi-structured
  * Azure Tables
  * Azure Cosmos DB
  * Mongo DB
  * Apache Cassandra
* Structured
  * Postgres
  * MySQL
  * Azure SQL
  * Azure Synapse Analytics

## Unstructured

>Files in a folder, with random files and folders

* Loose data
* Not optimized for search or analysis

## Semi-structured

>JSON and XML files

* Has no schema
* Has some form of relationship
* Has limitations on search
* Has fields but...
  * Don`t have to be the same in every entity
  * Are only defined when needed depending on the entity

File formats

* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  * Easy for humans to read and write
  * Easy parsing and generation
* ORC (Apache Optimized Row Columnar)
  * Columnar reads, predictive pushdown and lazy reads
  * Organized in stripes of data (up to 250 MB)
  * File footer, stripe footer, raw data, index data
* Parquet
  * Columnar storage
  * Efficient compression and encoding schemes
  * Record shredding and assembly algorithm
* AVRO
  * Row-based
  * Compact, fast, binary data format
  * Container file
  * RPC

## Structured

>Relational database

* Has a schema
* Has relationships
* Easy to search for related data
* Most common is tabular data

## Datasets

*MNIST Dataset*

>A logical grouping of data

## Notebooks

*Jupyter Notebook*

>Data that is arranged in pages, designed for easy consumption

# Concepts

* Batch and Streaming Data
* Relational and Non Relational
* Data Modelling
* Schema and Schemaless
* Data Integrity and Data Corruption
* Normalized and Denormalized

## Batch vs Stream Processing

[Text](../../../texts/batch_vs_stream_processing.md)

## Relational Data

* __Tables__ logical grouping of rows
* __Views__ result set of a stored query on data stored in memory (temporary table)
* __Materialized Views__ result set stored query on data stored on disk
* __Indexes__ copy of the data sorted by one or multiple columns for faster reads at the cost of storage
* __Constraints__ rules applied to writes, that can ensure data integrity
* __Triggers__ a function that is triggered on a specific database event
* __Primary Key__ a column which holds the value of the primary key from another key to establish a relationship

### Relationships

* One-to-one
* One-to-many
* Many-to-many
* Many-to-many via a junction table

## Schema vs Schemaless

A schema is a formal language which describes the structure of data and can define many different data structures, serving different purposes.

It is schemaless when the cell can accept many data types, allowing developers to forgo upfront data modelling.

## Query and Querying

A query is a request for data results (reads) to perform operations like inserting, updating or deleting data (writes).

* Query
* Data Result
* Querying
* Query Language

### Row-store vs Column-store

* __Row-store__
  * Traditional relational databases
  * Good for general purpose databases
  * Suited for Online transaction processing
  * Not the best at analytics or massive amounts of data
* __Column-store__
  * Faster at aggregating values at analytics
  * Usually NoSQL-like databases
  * Good for vast amount of data
  * Suited for Online analytical processing

### Database Indexes

Improves the speed of reads from the table by storing redundant data (usually a B-Tree in disk).

## Data Integrity vs Data Corruption

* __Data integrity__ is the maintenance and assurance of data accuracy and consistency over its entire life-cycle.
* __Data corruption__ is the act or state of data not being in the intended state that will result in data loss or misinformation

## Normalized vs Denormalized

* __Normalized__ A schema designed to store non-redundant and consistent data
  * Data integrity is maintained
  * Little redundant data
  * Many tables
  * Optimized storage
* __Denormalized__ A schema that combines data so that accessing data is fast
  * Data integrity is not maintained
  * Redundant data is common
  * Fewer tables
  * Storage is less optimal

## Pivot Table

A table of statistics that summarizes (by __aggregation__) the data of a more complex extensive table. Used in data processing to draw attention to useful information and find figures and facts quickly.

## Strongly Consistent vs Eventually Consistent

* __Strongly Consistent__ means that every time you request data, you can expect consistent data to be return within `x` time, possible seconds or more
* __Eventually Consistent__ means that when you request data, you may get inconsistent data, but it will eventually be consistent

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

* __Synchronous__ continuous stream of data that is synchronized by a timer (guarantee of time)
* __Asynchronous__ continuous stream of data separated by start and stop bits (no guarantee of time)

## Non Relational Data

Non-tabular form and optimized for different data structures

* Key/Value
* Document
* Columnar
* Graph
* A combination of these

# Data Mining

# Data Wrangling

>Process of transforming and mapping data from one raw data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for other purposes

1. Discovery
2. Structuring
3. Cleaning
4. Enriching
5. Validating
6. Publishing

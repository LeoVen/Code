## Data Overview

* **Data** - units of information
* **Data Documents** - types of abstract groupings and data
* **Data Sets** - unstructured logical grouping of data
* **Data Structures** - structured data
* **Data Types** - how single units of data are intended to be used

## Concepts

* Batch and Streaming Data
* Relational and Non Relational
* Data Modelling
* Schema and Schemaless
* Data Integrity and Data Corruption
* Normalized and De-normalized

## Data Documents

A data document defines the collective form in which data exists

Examples:
* **Datasets** (*MNIST Dataset*) - a logical grouping of data
* **Databases** (*Azure SQL*) - structured data that can be quickly accessed and searched
* **Datastores** (*Azure Data Lake*) - Unstructured or semi-structured data housing
* **Data warehouses** (*Azure Synapse Analytics*) - structured or semi-structured data for creating reports and analytics
* **Notebooks** (*Jupyter Notebook*) - data that is arranged in pages, designed for easy consumption

## Data Type

A single unit of data that describes how the data is intended to be used

* Numeric
  * Integer
  * Float (Decimal)
* Text Data Types
  * Character
  * String
* Composite
  * Array
  * Hash (Dictionary)
* Binary
* Boolean
* Enumeration

## Schema vs Schemaless

A schema is a formal language which describes the structure of data and can define many different data structures, serving different purposes.

It is schemaless when the cell can accept many data types, allowing developers to forgo upfront data modelling.

## Query and Querying

A query is a request for data results (reads) to perform operations like inserting, updating or deleting data (writes).

* Query
* Data Result
* Querying
* Query Language

## Batch vs Stream Processing

### Batch

Examples of processing: payroll, billing, orders from customers.

* Send a batch at a time to be processed
* Can be scheduled
* Not real-time
* Ideal for very large processing workloads
* More cost-effective

### Streaming

Examples of processing: log monitoring, customer behavior, fraud detection.

* Producers send data to the stream
* Consumers pull data from the stream
* More expensive than batch processing

>Batch data can also be transformed into streaming data and vice-versa.

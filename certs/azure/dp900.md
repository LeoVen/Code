## Data Overview

* __Data__ - units of information
* __Data Documents__ - types of abstract groupings and data
* __Data Sets__ - unstructured logical grouping of data
* __Data Structures__ - structured data
* __Data Types__ - how single units of data are intended to be used

## Concepts

* Batch and Streaming Data
* Relational and Non Relational
* Data Modelling
* Schema and Schemaless
* Data Integrity and Data Corruption
* Normalized and Denormalized

## Data Documents

A data document defines the collective form in which data exists

Examples:
* __Datasets__ (*MNIST Dataset*) - a logical grouping of data
* __Databases__ (*Azure SQL*) - structured data that can be quickly accessed and searched
* __Datastores__ (*Azure Data Lake*) - Unstructured or semi-structured data housing
* __Data warehouses__ (*Azure Synapse Analytics*) - structured or semi-structured data for creating reports and analytics
* __Notebooks__ (*Jupyter Notebook*) - data that is arranged in pages, designed for easy consumption

## Data Type

A single unit of data that describes how the data is intended to be used

* Numeric
  * Integer
  * Float (Decimal)
* Text Data Types
  * Character
  * String
* Composite
  * Array
  * Hash (Dictionary)
* Binary
* Boolean
* Enumeration

## Schema vs Schemaless

A schema is a formal language which describes the structure of data and can define many different data structures, serving different purposes.

It is schemaless when the cell can accept many data types, allowing developers to forgo upfront data modelling.

## Query and Querying

A query is a request for data results (reads) to perform operations like inserting, updating or deleting data (writes).

* Query
* Data Result
* Querying
* Query Language

## Batch vs Stream Processing

### Batch

Examples of processing: payroll, billing, orders from customers.

* Send a batch at a time to be processed
* Can be scheduled
* Not real-time
* Ideal for very large processing workloads
* More cost-effective

### Streaming

Examples of processing: log monitoring, customer behavior, fraud detection.

* Producers send data to the stream
* Consumers pull data from the stream
* More expensive than batch processing

>Batch data can also be transformed into streaming data and vice-versa.

## Relational Data

* __Tables__ logical grouping of rows
* __Views__ result set of a stored query on data stored in memory (temporary table)
* __Materialized Views__ result set stored query on data stored on disk
* __Indexes__ copy of the data sorted by one or multiple columns for faster reads at the cost of storage
* __Constraints__ rules applied to writes, that can ensure data integrity
* __Triggers__ a function that is triggered on a specific database event
* __Primary Key__ a column which holds the value of the primary key from another key to establish a relationship

### Relationships

* One-to-one
* One-to-many
* Many-to-many
* Many-to-many via a junction table

### Row-store vs Column-store

* __Row-store__
  * Traditional relational databases
  * Good for general purpose databases
  * Suited for Online transaction processing
  * Not the best at analytics or massive amounts of data
* __Column-store__
  * Faster at aggregating values at analytics
  * Usually NoSQL-like databases
  * Good for vast amount of data
  * Suited for Online analytical processing

### Database Indexes

Improves the speed of reads from the table by storing redundant data (usually a B-Tree in disk).

## Data Integrity vs Data Corruption

* __Data integrity__ is the maintenance and assurance of data accuracy and consistency over its entire life-cycle.
* __Data corruption__ is the act or state of data not being in the intended state that will result in data loss or misinformation

## Normalized vs Denormalized

* __Normalized__ A schema designed to store non-redundant and consistent data
  * Data integrity is maintained
  * Little redundant data
  * Many tables
  * Optimized storage
* __Denormalized__ A schema that combines data so that accessing data is fast
  * Data integrity is not maintained
  * Redundant data is common
  * Fewer tables
  * Storage is less optimal

## Pivot Table

A table of statistics that summarizes (by __aggregation__) the data of a more complex extensive table. Used in data processing to draw attention to useful information and find figures and facts quickly.

## Strongly Consistent vs Eventually Consistent

* __Strongly Consistent__ means that every time you request data, you can expect consistent data to be return within `x` time, possible seconds or more
* __Eventually Consistent__ means that when you request data, you may get inconsistent data, but it will eventually be consistent

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

* __Synchronous__ continuous stream of data that is synchronized by a timer (guarantee of time)
* __Asynchronous__ continuous stream of data separated by start and stop bits (no guarantee of time)

## Non Relational Data

Non-tabular form and optimized for different data structures

* Key/Value
* Document
* Columnar
* Graph
* A combination of these
